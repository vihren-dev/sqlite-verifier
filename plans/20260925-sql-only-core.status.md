# SQL-only core cleanup status

Created: 2026-09-25. Status: IN PROGRESS.

Task: [sql-only-core.task.md](20260925-sql-only-core.task.md).
Authority: owner's explicit SQL-file universal-interface correction, 2026-09-25.
Starting revision: d6c46ef1. Lean toolchain is pinned by lean-toolchain; the Nix
environment stays isolated in nix/. No framework or application execution is a
product requirement. Owner review of application meaning remains separate from
mechanical validation.

Progress: audited the profile-to-execution coupling; preparing source-backed SQL
example and removal of SQLx semantics, capture infrastructure and documentation.
Validation: pending implementation. No claim of equivalence or passing tests yet.
