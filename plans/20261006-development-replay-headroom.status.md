# Development replay headroom status

Status: IN PROGRESS. Created 2026-10-06.

Task: [development replay headroom](20261006-development-replay-headroom.task.md).
Source: [issue #33](https://github.com/vihren-dev/sqlite-verifier/issues/33).

## Progress

- 2026-10-06: Created workspace `replay-headroom` from reviewed T04b tip
  `06442f62`. The old storage workspace and its pending review journal
  remain unchanged. Read the issue, which has no comments, the approved
  task outcome, storage evidence, tier, loading and native-model boundary.
- 2026-10-06: Policy version 1 selects all 69 authored v5 cases, all two
  synthetic cases, one case per nonempty upstream source, and eight
  additional identities. Loading verifies every case and all acquisition
  and fidelity evidence before selection. No selected SQL or frozen bytes
  have changed. Requested an idle local host slot for fresh profiling.
- 2026-10-06: The current phase guard is 120 seconds, while historical
  receipts and documentation describe 60 seconds. The speed target is
  separately less than 30 seconds. No deadline has been raised.

## Validation

Pending: fresh phase profiles, focused regression checks, unchanged corpus
byte comparison, independent review, and bounded macOS/Linux measurements.
