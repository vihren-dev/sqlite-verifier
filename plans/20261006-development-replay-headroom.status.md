# Development replay headroom status

Status: IN PROGRESS. Created 2026-10-06.

Task: [development replay headroom](20261006-development-replay-headroom.task.md).
Source: [issue #33](https://github.com/vihren-dev/sqlite-verifier/issues/33).

## Progress

- 2026-10-06: Created workspace `replay-headroom` from reviewed T04b tip
  `06442f62`. The old storage workspace and its pending review journal
  remain unchanged. Read the issue, which has no comments, the approved
  task outcome, storage evidence, tier, loading and native-model boundary.
- 2026-10-06: Policy version 1 selects all 69 authored v5 cases, all two
  synthetic cases, one case per nonempty upstream source, and eight
  additional identities. Loading verifies every case and all acquisition
  and fidelity evidence before selection. No selected SQL or frozen bytes
  have changed. Requested an idle local host slot for fresh profiling.
- 2026-10-06: The current phase guard is 120 seconds, while historical
  receipts and documentation describe 60 seconds. The speed target is
  separately less than 30 seconds. No deadline has been raised.
- 2026-10-06: Reported the deadline discrepancy to the coordinator, who
  requested owner feedback. Changes to the guard remain pending. The
  coordinator authorized read-only profiling with the guard unchanged.
- 2026-10-06: One bounded diagnostic ran on the idle local host using the
  retained pinned Python 3.12.8 and conformance runtime, with explicit
  ordinary-file storage. It passed all 184 native comparisons and reported
  184 `MODEL_UNSUPPORTED`. The instrumented phase took 72.44 seconds:
  generic loading 65.84, synthetic loading 0.03, native replay 4.22, model
  classification 1.61, runtime binding 0.10, and selection 0.06. These are
  profiler timings, not acceptance measurements. Its 120-second process
  bound was unchanged. Local artifacts are in `build/headroom-profile/`.
- 2026-10-06: Profiling attributes 49.96 cumulative seconds to independent
  snapshot `deepcopy` operations in `native_storage.expanded_record`, with
  about 218 million total function calls. Loading's JSON decoding took
  6.01 seconds and canonical serialization 5.73 seconds. The existing
  validated snapshot bytes can support independent JSON reconstruction
  through the standard library. Requested coordinator feedback before
  this isolated change while the deadline question remains pending.
- 2026-10-06: The diagnostic process is terminal with exit code 0. Released
  the reserved local host slot to the Tcl task. No code or frozen evidence
  changed during profiling.

## Validation

Pending: fresh phase profiles, focused regression checks, unchanged corpus
byte comparison, independent review, and bounded macOS/Linux measurements.
